```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/DevsTrons/Hello-World
```
4. Run a command, so it will host the website up on port `4000` locally.
```
make
```
5. After done with the changes in code, get ready to contribute, Excited ? :star_struck: 

6. Make your own branch, so it'll hold your name, as well as which part you gone to be changing.
```
git checkout -b <username-which_part>
```
- For eg., Lets assume, the documentation part is fixed/enhanced by someone, & his name is "Amin", the branch will be name as "amin-docs"
```
git checkout -b amin-docs
```

7. Now, you've to add the changes in that branch, you created just above.
```
git add .
```
8. Lets commit the changes, & earn "green square of the day".
```
git commit -m "<message>"
```
9. Now, just push the changes from your repo. to original repository.
```
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```
10. Once you've committed and pushed all of your changes to GitHub, go to the page for your fork on GitHub, select your development branch, and click the pull request button. If you need to make any adjustments to your pull request, just push the updates to GitHub. Your pull request will automatically track the changes in your development branch and update it.

**NOTE:**

=> "LGTM ðŸ¥³ or Looks Good/Great To Me" is the word, you're seeking from reviewers.
