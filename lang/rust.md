## ‚öôÔ∏è What is Rust?
 
Rust, as defined by Steve Nichols in _"The Rust Programming Language"_ is a programming language that balances high-level ergonomics and low-level control, abstracting resource control just enough so you can have control over low-level details but it won't be a hassle.

It has been voted as "the most loved programming language" by the Stack Overflow Developer Survey every year since 2016. Rust is multi-paradigm, with compilation and package managing achieved by its own set of tools, _rustc_, and _cargo_, respectively.
 
## ü§î Why to use Rust?

Rust had, ever since its inception, the objective of allowing the power of C/C++ without the hassle and the risks that come with them. One of the main problems it tried to tackle was the risk of dealing with memory at the level of C++ without resorting to a garbage collector. It achieved this with the concept of **ownership and borrowing**, allowing the usage of pointers as in C/C++ but keeping those in their respective context by default, destroying pointers after exiting their blocks, greatly increasing security and making their management easier, as per the [reference manual](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html). This and many other implementations of powerful concepts in an ergonomic way allowed Rust to be easily adopted in many projects while increasing their security and readability, making the language a favorite in the programming community.

## üßê What is Rust currently used for?

Today, Rust's development is [sponsored by Mozilla](https://research.mozilla.org/rust/), being adopted in the development of Firefox, its most known product. Rust is also currently being used by other big corporations like [Dropbox and Cloudfare](https://www.rust-lang.org/), with its adoption in the development of the Linux kernel being [currently discussed](https://www.zdnet.com/article/rust-in-the-linux-kernel-why-it-matters-and-whats-happening-next/).

Rust has grown beyond being a systems language and being adopted for various things because of the underlying security in memory management.

## üèÅ Starting with Rust development

The best way to install Rust is to use its management tool `rustup`, which can be installed:

- On Linux, macOS or other Unix-like OS by running `$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh` on the terminal
- On Windows or other platforms, check [the manual](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html)

`rustup` will also take care of installing the Rust package manager `cargo` and the compiler `rustc`. For more information, check [their Getting Started web page](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
 
### üëã Writing your first 'Hello, world!' program

With Rust installed and configured, create a new file with the `rs` extension in a folder of your choosing, for example, `hello_world.rs`, and write to it the code below

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Now, in the same folder your code is located, run `rustc hello_world.rs` (consider `hello_world` being your file name, if different). This will create a file called simply `hello_world` in Unix-like systems or `hello_world.exe` on Windows. To run your code, on Unix-like systems run in your terminal `./hello_world` or `.\hello_world.exe` on Windows and you should get `Hello, world!` as your output. Hooray! Your first Rust program is ready.

### üîç Where to go next?

Now that you have the necessary tools installed, you can get to the language's manual by running `rustup docs --book` in your terminal or by accessing [the online manual in your browser](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). Some good books on Rust development are _"Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development"_ by Jim Blandy and Jason Orendorff and _"The Rust Programming Language"_ by Steve Klabnik Carol Nichols.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tooling around Rust
1. [Cargo Doc](https://docs.rs): Cargo‚Äôs doc builder makes it so no API ever goes undocumented. It‚Äôs available locally through `cargo doc`, and online for public crates through docs.rs.
2. [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy): ‚ÄúIt looks like you‚Äôre writing an Iterator.‚Äù Clippy helps developers of all experience levels write idiomatic code, and enforce standards.
3. [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt): Rustfmt automatically formats Rust code, making it easier to read, write, and maintain. And most importantly: never debate spacing or brace position ever again.

## üòé Some cool projects in Rust

- [CancerIQ](http://www.canceriq.com): uses Rust for many risk models analyzing genetic material
- [Firefox](https://research.mozilla.org/rust): Mozilla is more and more adopting Rust as the language for key parts of the development of Firefox
- [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo.co.uk): Deliveroo uses Rust to make efficient assignment decisions on its delivery network
- [TheAlgorithms/Rust](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Rust): Algorithms, data structures, methods, etc. all in one repository in Rust

## ‚ú® Conclusion 

Rust is a really hot language in the industry right now, so getting a good grasp of its usage is a great way to advance your career in CompSci or to understand the probable future of systems development!
