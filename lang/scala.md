## What is Scala?

Scala is a modern programming language designed and created by Martin Odersky. The design of the language started in 2001 and was released to the public in early 2004. Martin Odersky had a huge hand in the implementation of javac (the primary Java compiler) and also designed Generic Java, a facility of generic programming that was added to the Java programming language in 2004. This is why it doesn‚Äôt come as a surprise that Scala is similar to Java in many aspects, it‚Äôs actually written to run in JVM (Java Virtual Machine).

## Why to use Scala?

- Scala has an exact syntax, eliminating boilerplate code. Programs written in Scala require less code than similar programs written in Java.
- It is both an object-oriented language and a functional language. This combination makes Scala the right choice for web development.
- Scala uses an expressive typing system that ensures statistical abstraction is secure and consistent.
- It‚Äôs easy to learn, especially for programmers with an object-oriented background with Java or similar language.
- Scala is highly scalable, useful for building fault-tolerant, highly concurrent systems
- It‚Äôs ideal for data analytics when supported by tools like Apache Spark


## Setting up Scala development environment

- Step 1: Verifying Java Packages
- The first thing we need to have is a Java Software Development Kit(SDK) installed on the computer. We need to verify these SDK packages and if not installed then install them. Open the command window and type in the following commands:

- For users using Windows:
`C:\Users\Your_PC_username>java -version`

- Step 2: Installing Scala 
- We are done with installing the Java SDK. Now let‚Äôs install the Scala packages. The best option to download these packages is to download from the official site only: https://www.scala-lang.org/download/ 
The packages in the link above are approximately 100MB. Once the packages are downloaded, open the downloaded `.msi` file and install it.

- Step 3: Testing and running the Scala Commands
- Open the command prompt now and type in the following codes:
`C:\Users\Your_PC_username>scala`

## Conclusion

- Scala is a strong statically typed general-purpose programming language which supports both object-oriented programming and functional programming. Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions are aimed to address criticisms of Java.
