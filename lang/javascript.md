## üíõ What is JavaScript? 
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. JS is invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. Google, YouTube, Wikipedia, Yahoo, Amazon, Facebook, eBay, LinkedIn, Twitter and lot more have been built using Js. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. It can update and change both HTML and CSS. It can calculate, manipulate and validate data. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative  styles. 

## üñ§ Why to use JavaScript?
- JavaScript works on web users‚Äô computers ‚Äî even when they are offline!
- JavaScript allows you to create responsive interfaces that improve the user experience and provide dynamic functionality, without having to wait for the server to react and show another page.
- JS allows you to fetch different APIs, thus making it easier to distribute services and information to new audiences and in specific contexts that can be customized to provide tailored user experiences.
- A large number of web applications have a server-side to them. JavaScript is used to generate content and handle HTTP requests.
- For developers, JS is easy to learn and fast to get into active development. Its syntax is easy and flexible for newcomers.

## Setting up JavaScript Development Environment!
For setting up JavaScript development environment, we must have atleast two things, a browser and an editor.

#### You can have any of these browsers in your system
- Microsoft Edge
- Google Chrome
- Safari
- Mozilla Firefox
- Opera

#### Following are the JavaScript editors:
- Visual Studio Code
- Eclipse
- Notepad++
- Atom
- Code Lobster
- WebStorm

Step 1Ô∏è: Install Node and npm for package management
Visit the website [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and install NodeJs as per your PC specifications.

To install npm, simply type the following in commandline:
```sh
npm install
```

In command prompt, and type this: <br />
**For checking the version of  NodeJs:**
```sh
node -v
```
**After that, checking the version of npm  using the following command:**
```sh
npm -v 
```
**Step 2Ô∏è: Install Babel to transpile JS code**

If we wouldn‚Äôt have npm installed, we would have to manually go to Babel‚Äôs website, download the tool, install and configure it. However, with npm, you can just type in the terminal:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @babel/cli@7.8.4 @babel/core@7.0.0 @babel/preset-env@7.0.0 @babel/register@7.0.0 @babel/node@7.0.0
```
**Step 3Ô∏è: Install JS Editor**
You are all set, don't forget to save the file using .js extension for JavaScript files!

## üñ§ Conclusion
We‚Äôve come a long way, from getting to know about JavaScript to an overview of JavaScript Projects. Start new, start fresh! Keep the following things in mind: 
Use a text editor to write and save JavaScript and HTML files. 
Organize the files for a project using folders and appropriate filenames. 
Find out more and get help at the [Developer Mozilla Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [Stack Overflow](stackoverflow.com)
Make the most of the resources on the book‚Äôs website. 
Practice, practice, practice. Be curious, adventurous, resilient, and patient. Good luck on your adventures!
