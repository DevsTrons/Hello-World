 ## üêç What is SQL?
 
SQL  is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables. SQL offers two main advantages over older read‚Äìwrite APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index.

SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. Since then, the standard has been revised to include a larger set of features. Despite the existence of standards, most SQL code requires at least some changes before being ported to different database systems.

### ü§î Why is SQL so popular?

There are many reasons for the ubiquity of sql , including :

- **Easy to Learn and Use**

- **Mature and Supportive Community**

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools You Will Need

You are probably familiar with Windows as they are widely used throughout the world. The latest version of Windows is Windows 10. Generally, you should be on the latest version of the OS, but if you have an older machine or other software requires it, you might be stuck with Windows 7 or older. 

If you go for Windows, there are some shell options for you. Windows comes with the Command line, but also Powershell. Powershell feels more like a normal terminal you would know from the Linux- or Mac world.

Most text editors and IDEs work on macOS.

macOS, like Windows, is not Open source, but it comes with the machine. macOS only works on a Mac (officially) so you are tied down to Apple hardware.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up Python development environment

One of the most important things you‚Äôll do when working with any programming language is setup a development environment which allows you to execute the code you write. Without this, you will never be able to check your work and see if your website or application is free of syntax errors.

#### **‚öôÔ∏è How to Get Started with SQL**

As you already know SQL is used to communicate with the database, so before you start experimenting with SQL, you need access to a database system first.

You can test or execute most of the SQL statements provided as examples throughout the tutorials, using our online SQL editor. This SQL editor uses Web SQL Database to store and access data on the client side. However, to execute some SQL statement you'll need access to a full-fledged database management system like MySQL, SQL Server etc.

Note: Web SQL Database allows you to create SQL databases and make SQL calls on the client side. It is based on the popular and open source SQLite engine. Web SQL is supported by Chrome, Opera and Safari browsers.

**What is Relational Database**

A relational database is a database divided into logical units called tables, where tables are related to one another within the database. Relational database allows data to be broken down into logical, smaller, and manageable units for easier maintenance and better performance.

Tables are related to one another through common keys or fields in a relational database system, that's why even though the desired data may exist in more than one table, you can easily join multiple tables together to get combined data set using a single query.

Note: SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. Although, most SQL code is not completely portable among different database systems without adjustments.

**Setting Up Work Environment for Practicing SQL**

If you have no DBMS (Database Management System) already installed on your system, you have several options to choose from. You can install a free, open-source DBMS.

MySQL is the most popular and widely supported open-source database management system. It is very easy to download and use and available for both Windows and Linux (or UNIX) operating system. You can download it freely from here https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

You can also install SQL Server Express. It is a free version of Microsoft SQL Server which allows up to 10GB of database storage. You can download the express edition from here https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=30438.

Alternatively, if you're planning to develop an application with PHP and MySQL you can install WampServer or XAMPP. WampServer is a Windows web development environment. It allows you to create web applications with Apache2, PHP and a MySQL database. It will also provide the MySQL administrative tool PhpMyAdmin to easily manage your databases using a web browser. You can download it from here http://www.wampserver.com/en/

**‚öôÔ∏è Which Version Should I Use?**

Long story short, it‚Äôs entirely up to you which version of SQL you use! There‚Äôs no right or wrong answer, and it‚Äôs painless to make the jump from one version to another should you realize you need to do so later on.
