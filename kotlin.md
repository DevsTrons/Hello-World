## üìöWhat is Kotlin?

[Kotlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)) is a statically typed, object-oriented programming language that is interoperable with the [Java virtual machine (JVM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine), Java Class Libraries and Android.

The Kotlin programming language was originally designed to improve the Java programming language and is often used in conjunction with Java. Despite being the preferred development language of Android, Kotlin's interoperability with Java has led it to be used with many application types.

## ü§î Why to use Kotlin? 
- **Expressive**: Kotlin's concise syntax makes code easier to read and write.
- **Safe**: Kotlin's null safety features help prevent common errors.
- **Interoperable**: Kotlin works seamlessly with Java, so you can reuse existing code and libraries.
- **Fast**: Kotlin compiles to bytecode, so it's as fast as Java.
- **Multi-platform**: Kotlin can be used to develop apps for Android, iOS, desktop, and the web.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting up Kotlin development environment

- Install the [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit). Kotlin runs on the [Java virtual machine (JVM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine), so you need to have the JDK installed on your system. You can download the JDK from the ] [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com) website.
- Install the [Kotlin compiler](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/command-line.html#snap-package). You can download the latest version of the Kotlin compiler from the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) website.
- Set up your `PATH` variable. On Windows, you can do this by editing the Path environment variable. On macOS and Linux, you can do this by editing the `PATH` variable in your `.bashrc` file.
- Create a new Kotlin project. You can do this using the Kotlin compiler or using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio.

## üìëConclusion

Kotlin is a powerful object-oriented programming language that supports multiple platforms and runs on JVM. It is the first choice for many developers for Android development. It has a great community and many companies are shifting toward Kotlin from Java which means more opportunities are getting generated for Kotlin developers. It is gaining more and more popularity and it has the ability to interoperate with Java.
